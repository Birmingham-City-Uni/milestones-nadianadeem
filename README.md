<h1> Nadia Nadeem - Zombie Mayhem </h1>
<h3> An endless 2D zombie shooting game. Kill all zombies in your way. </h3>

<p> Zombie mayhem is set in a dark dystopian world where the main character 'Madison' is fighting of waves of zombies, she is the only survivor left on Earth! Over time the number of zombies in each wave increase as well as the zombies health increase as the rounds progress. The game is from a top-down view of the world. </p>

<p> The user will be able to move Madision using the keyboard keys and the spacebar will be used to shoot the gun that Madison will be holding.</p>

<p> My unique mechanics will be that, Madison will be able to collect health power-ups as well as a bomb power-up that will destroy all zombies on the screen. The more zombies killed the higher the score attained, there will be a leaderboard as part of the game that will save the top 10 scores every achieved on that specific download of the game. I also aim to have the background and the aesthetic look of the zombies change once the player reaches specific round milestones.</p>

<h3> Dev Log </h3>
<p> 17/11/2020 - The enemies of the game have been created as well as a shooting mechanic with working collisions. In addition to this when a bullet collides with an enemy there is a UI overlay showing a score that it increase by 1 every time an enemy is shot. I have found the assets for the zombies but they are part of a sprite sheet, my next task is working on animations for the game, the zombies shall hopefully be implemented then. </p>

<p> 13/11/2020 - Tile map has been implemented as well as the character being created also. I have decided to make a top down game instead of a side-view game as it will be straightforward to implmenet shooting and pathfind mechanics. Assets for top-down games were slightly easier to find when looking for zombies assets that matched the aesthetic of Zombie Mayhem. </p>

<p> 28/10/2020 - Basic game loop created as well as the creation of a screen and the README document. Assets for the game have been found.</p>
