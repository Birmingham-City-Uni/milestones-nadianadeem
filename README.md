<h1> Nadia Nadeem - Zombie Mayhem </h1>
<h3> An endless 2D zombie shooting game. Kill all zombies in your way. </h3>

<p> Zombie mayhem is set in a dark dystopian world where the main character 'Madison' is fighting of waves of zombies, she is the only survivor left on Earth! Over time the number of zombies in each wave increase as well as the zombies health increase as the rounds progress. The game is from a top-down view of the world. </p>

<p> The user will be able to move Madision using the keyboard keys and the spacebar will be used to shoot the gun that Madison will be holding.</p>

<p> My unique mechanics will be that, Madison will be able to collect health power-ups as well as a bomb power-up that will destroy all zombies on the screen. The more zombies killed the higher the score attained, there will be a leaderboard as part of the game that will save the top 10 scores every achieved on that specific download of the game. I also aim to have the background and the aesthetic look of the zombies change once the player reaches specific round milestones.</p>
